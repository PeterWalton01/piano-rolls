# Codecademy Challenge: A Company Home Page with Flexbox

This project was completed as part of the Codecademy Full-Stack Engineer course. Specifically, the project covers the <i>Company Home Page with Flexbox challenge</i> project.

Within this challenge, we were given a very broad brief, and asked to produce a responsive website using <i>flexbox</i>, that met the requirements. The design and obtaining of supporting resources were part of the challenge. The brief was as follows:

> You’re going to build a company homepage for a real or imagined company. You’ll get to decide exactly what content to include for this company, but you should at least include:
>
> 1. A title and logo or splash image.
> 2. A mission statement or brief description of the company.
> 3. A list or set of images and titles representing the product or products of the company.
> 4. A section describing some of the company’s employees or teammates.

I envisaged a company that sold and maintained pianos and tried to give a sense of the beauty of the instruments, and of the dedication to quality to be found in the company staff.

### Some implementation details

This was the first challenge where the pages were to be designed from scratch. Previous challenges started from broken code.

Starting from scratch made coding easier as it was possible to consider the use of <i>flexbox</i> and its ability to morph by means of media queries. The design was very much top-down, and the fine tuning was completed in well-designed blocks.

### Nitty-gritty details

The most tricky part of the development was establishing and controlling the view onto the piano keyboard image. The use of <i>covers</i> and hiding <i>overflow</i> were the key ideas.

## How to use

Open the <i>index.html</i> file with a suitable browser. The project has only one page.
